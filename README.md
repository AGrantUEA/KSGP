# KSGP
Scripts used to generate KSGP database from sources

The scripts are not entirely machine independent, but are provided to document the processes used to generate the GTDB+ and KSGP databases. KSGP_v3i is a SLURM batch job that generates the complete database with flags that can be set if only parts of the database need to be regenerated
